# Competitive Programming

Welcome to my **Competitive Programming** repository! This repo contains solutions to a variety of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems I have solved using different programming languages. Each folder is organized by programming language, and each file represents a solution to a specific problem.

Feel free to explore or use these solutions as references for your own competitive programming journey.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
- Each folder corresponds to a **programming language** (e.g., Python, C++, Java).
- Within each folder, there are files representing the **solutions** to various problems solved in that particular language.
- File names follow the format `problem_name.extension` (e.g., `example.py`).

## How to Contribute

Want to contribute to this repository? Follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sehtaj/competitive-programming.git
   ```
2. **Open the project in Visual Studio Code** or your preferred code editor.

3. **Add a new file** for the problem you're solving under the appropriate programming language folder. For example, if you're solving a problem in Python, add problem_name.py in the Python folder.

4. **Solve the problem**, and test your solution by running it in the terminal:
   ```bash
   python problem_name.py
   ```
5. **Once all test cases pass**, commit your solution to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Solved problem_name.py"
   git push origin main
   ```
