# edge cases
# 1. No refueling needed
# minRefuel(100, 100, [])  -> 0

# 2. One station exactly where fuel runs out
# minRefuel(100, 50, [[50, 50]])  -> 1

# 3. Not enough fuel and no stations
# minRefuel(100, 1, [])  -> -1

# 4. Multiple stations, still canâ€™t reach
# minRefuel(1000, 1, [[10, 10], [20, 20], [30, 30]])  -> -1

# 5. One good station makes it possible
# minRefuel(100, 10, [[10, 90]])  -> 1

# 6. Skipping stations gives optimal result
# minRefuel(100, 10, [[10, 60], [20, 30], [30, 30], [60, 40]])  -> 2
